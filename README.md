# Project 3



# Airline statistics and delay causes
**Project Description:** The overall goal of this project is to investigate the general basis of flight delays and identify airlines, airports and routes with the highest delay rates. Data Flight delay statistics for this project are originally sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics(BTS). The project demonstrates visualizations with multiple views on flight delay dataset across major airports, airlines, routes and months of the year. The airlines report the causes of delays in five broad categories: Air Carrier, Extreme Weather, National Aviation System (NAS), Late-arriving aircraft, Security. It provides users the ability to easily access and interpret timeseries flight delay statistics for various airports spread across the USA and the reason of likelihood a flight will be delayed at a particular airport and the trending performance of a particular airport in terms of its likelihood of flight delay.

**Project Proposal:** The overall goal of this project is to continue with our project 2 but dig deeper. We will use D3 visualizations to create a flight prediction tool in order to see how flights will be affected based on weather, traffic, air carrier delays, etc. We want to create an interactive calendar that will give you an estimated delays for the time one is traveling. More interactive map for flights in the USA and a weather report for each airport to see how it affects delays.

**Hypothesis:** We believe that during the winter/holidays air traffic and delays will affect flights. 
Data source: The dataset pertaining to flight delays is downloaded from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), Airline Service Quality Performance 234 which stores, analyzes and maintains the transportation data https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?pn=1 The dataset consists of information about 23 carriers and 373 airports from year 2013-2018. For the exact geo locations for each airport, we used the dataset airport codes locations.

**New enhancements to project 2:** Interactive D3 visualization • transitions and tool tips for D3 visualizations. • Interactive calendar • Interactive map 

**Technologies Used:** • Flask • HTML/CSS/Bootstrap • Database Postgress, sqlite • Plotly/D3 or any other technologies. • Deployment using Heroku

**Actions and Tasks:** • Analyze the BTS database. • Search for new data sets (not required) • Find and clean the data. Create schema. • Explore and visualize the data. • Determine the visualizations. • Create the web app using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS. • Plotting the routes and querying the code in flask python
